Still very much worth the visit.  The Kahuku Units remains open.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three months of eruptions in lower Puna punctuated by a damaging wildfire that burned nearly 3,800 acres of forest on Mauna Loa and Hurricane Lane lashing the Island with heavy rains and strong winds at the end of August the Island of Hawaii is in recovery mode and regaining normalcy.  AND we have a new Black Sand Beach at Pohoiki which IS accessible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USGS and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are reporting that sulfur dioxide emissions at Kilauea summit and in the Lower East Rift Zone in Puna, where lava flows were occurring, have fallen drastically since the start of August and are at their lowest combined level in more than a decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nKilauea\\'s latest eruption began May 3 with lava flowing continuously until Aug. 6. The affected Puna area, in the southeast corner of the island comprises one percent of the island of Hawaii, which is larger than all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  We are in Upper Puna and were not affected by the flow.\\r\\nVisit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   OR  USGS Kilauea for future updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nKAEO is an enthusiastic gardener,occasional travel agent, sometimes Hula Girl, Hawaii born, ambassador to the culture, caregiver, former Ad exec and sometimes \\'pretty good cook\\'.  She has lived on Oahu, Maui and now the \"best\"-Island of Hawaii.  I\\'ve hiked hundreds on miles on ALL the islands, in past days:  Mauna Loa, Waimanu, Polipoli, Waihee, Wailau, Hauula, the Koolaus & Wainae Mountains.  A kayak trip to Kalalau circumvented the difficult 10.8m hike.  KARL is a master tile setter and works on all phases of the Carpentry, Remodel & Building Industry.  He built Eco Hale; we estimate using at least 60% re-purposed materials.  He also built our home in Mountain View and worked with his family numerous times on the Mainland and Hawaii to build their homes.  He is a Huge sports fan (Raiders in particular).  Karl comes from a family that simply needs their toothbrush when someone announces \"Road Trip\"; hence thousands of miles visiting U.S. parks, cities and sights.  Our romance began on the island of Maui and our adventure, commitment and curiosity to/for one another continues.\\r\\nWe love the entrepreneurial, independent alternative lifestyle and very much enjoy sharing our slice of paradise in the rain forest.

       "   'comments': '***German review below***\\r\\n\\r\\nWe absolutely loved our stay at Kaeo & Karl\\'s hale. Actually, we both agreed that it was the best accommodation we have stayed in on all of the Hawaiian islands so far (hadn\\'t changed yet either). Kaeo & Karl were so nice & welcoming and made our stay even nicer and more memorable by giving us great tips on local activities & beaches, and sharing their garden-grown fruits with us. The hale was clean & comfortable with many nice touches & attention to detail. The \"outdoor shower\", which I was initially afraid of would mean showering on the lawn being bitten in the butt by mosquitoes, turned out to be a clean and beautiful separate room with a large window for good views into the rainforesty garden. You definitely need a car to get there, it\\'s a little out of the way, but we enjoyed that most and the privacy the hale and our hosts allowed us. Waking up and feeling as if you\\'re alone in a rainforest is pretty cool & special. Thank you Kaeo & Karl for the lovely time! We\\'d come back in a heartbeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Kaeo & Karl\\'s Gästehaus total genossen. Wir sind uns sogar einig, dass es unser schönstes airbnb Erlebnis von allen auf Hawaii (nicht nur der big island) war - und das hat sich auch bisher nicht geändert.\\r\\nKaeo & Karl sind super nett, haben uns herzlich empfangen und unseren Aufenthalt noch schöner gemacht indem sie uns tolle Tipps für Aktivitäten und Strände gegeben und die leckeren Früchte aus ihrem Garten mit uns geteilt haben. \\r\\nDas Gästehaus selbst war super sauber und hatte alles, was man so braucht, mit vielen schönen Details. Die Außendusche, von der ich erst annahm sie würde bedeuten \\'duschen auf dem Rasen mit lauter Mücken\\' ist ein sehr schöner Raum mit Toilette, Waschbecken, Duschkabine und großem Fenster mit Blick in den Regenwald-Garten. Toll! Ihr braucht definitiv ein Auto, ohne kommt man nicht hin, aber die Privatsphäre, die uns unsere Gastgeber gegeben haben und das Gefühl morgens alleine im Regenwald aufzuwachen (sehr schön!) war genau das, was wir uns gewünscht hatten. Wir würden sofort wieder hin fahren! '},\n",

The kitchen area was well stocked and there was a binder full of interesting information and recommendations. The bathroom is adjacent to the kitchen/bedroom space and is gorgeous. There was great hot water and water pressure in the shower. The location feels off the beaten path and remote but the directions to it are detailed and it’s easy to find. The rainforest setting is peaceful and private. Communication with Kaeo and Karl was relaxed and friendly. No complaints - we’d stay at the Eco Hale again in a heartbeat! '},\n",

Seriously, I had absolutely everything I needed -- including things above and beyond like coffee, papaya, avocado, filtered water and chocolate. And there seems to be an invisible orchid fairy wandering around in the jungle who delivers fragrant and fresh-picked flowers every time you turn around for more than a second. \\n\\nEco Hale is at a perfect location if you want to explore. Very easy access Volcano National Park. (I even hiked to see the lava from a point nearby -- amazing!). I also visited the hot ponds, the Portlandia-like little town of Pahoa, took yoga classes in Hilo, jaunted down to Kalani retreat center, saw the glowing crater late at night under a starlit sky, the Black Sand Beach, the Green Sand Beach and more... \\n\\nI thought about asking Kaeo and Karl if they would adopt me forever and ever, but all good things must come to an end. Don't worry about the rain, or the fact that you cannot walk to a white sand beach, or the lack of bars serving up Mai Thai in the immediate vicinity. None of these things are an obstacle. Come see what this luxurious little jungle cabin has in store for you.\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

At night, it seems as if you are staying in the middle of a jungle rainforest (though with surprisingly few pests; in fact, I didn't even notice mosquitoes at night). The cottage was clean and smartly outfitted; the owners included everything you might want for your Big Island adventures (snorkel equipment, beach chairs and towels, ponchos and umbrellas, etc.); Kaeo and Karl were even nice enough to leave us fresh fruit, banana bread, and other treats. I would definitely recommend Eco Hale for travelers eager to escape the resort scene and glimpse a bit of life in inland Hawaii. That said, it's barely a 25 minute drive (if that) to the Volcano Park or Hilo, so you are never that far from major tourist destinations. \"},\n",

Secluded without feeling disconnected, privacy without inattention, eco-friendly with all the comforts of nice accommodations -- plus a lot of sweet (literally!) little extras here and there, ample complementary snacks and staple foods to tie-over in a pinch, not to mention delicious samplings of fresh local fruits & snacks to really make \"downtime\" in this wonderful garden-place a treat to savor, rain or shine. My travel buddy arrived several hours after me, entailing a long drive across the island at night to collect him; when Kaeo realized this, she immediately offered to prepare a plate of food for us so we could come straight back and relax. She was making what would prove a lovely roast chicken with ample sides. She asked about my friend\\'s diet and I mentioned that he is pesco, but surely we\\'d do fine munching on whatever she was making. However, Kaeo insisted on cooking up a nice little Ahi steak, just for him! The welcome wagon from both Kaeo & Karl was warm indeed, beginning with enthusiastic and detailed arrival guidance a week before our stay, and they tended to our few needs while there seamlessly and with complete discretion -- we never saw either of them again during our stay until Kaeo dropped by the morning of our departure to send us on our way with a warm goodbye. Binders chock full of local interest and maps gave us everything we needed to make the most of our brief visit, and their lush and beautiful property was a constant feast for the senses, both inside and out. A very different kind of stay experience, with a quality that can\\'t be judged in relation the usual lodging options, but a fully and beautifully conceived package all its own. While deeply immersed in the local situation -- running water is pumped from a catchment, power is solar and to be used moderately, and the free wifi provided is a mobile hotspot with a limited data plan -- everything is nicely done (all the lights work, hot water is great, purified drinking water is provided, and the internet is there whenever you need it) -- we wanted for nothing. This is no cabin in the woods but a thoroughly pleasant, modern, modest yet comfortable, fully-appointed abode with everything you need (food and cooking stuff, nice personal care & bathroom products, fun things you might need for day trips, etc), steeped in the slightly wild Puna and the sense of sharing in the good life that Kaeo & Karl have lovingly built and nurtured here. The booking and transaction couldn\\'t have been smoother; all we had to do was leave HI sales tax in the envelope provided when we left. '},\n",

The pictures don't do this accommodation justice- it us even better in real life. The hale is set in  lush tropical gardens.

During our stay we got a lot of rain, but it didnt hold us back from being able to enjoy the many fun things to do in the area which are all fairly close by: exploring the town if Hilo, trekking through Volcano National park, and doing tons of snorkelling. A huge bonus were the snorkel gear and boogie boards our hosts provided for us to use!!  We would highly recommend Eco Hale to anyone looking for a peaceful and fun place to stay while on the big island. Our hosts were awesome.

The bathroom is right next door, also private, with hot water and also is so nice.

Kaeo is also a fabulous cook and sweetly made me some baked goods and breakfast a few times while I was there. I really enjoyed talking with Kaeo, she and Karl have really created a wonderful life on the Big Island  off the grid and super comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nKaeo also has great knowledge of the area and great recommendations for hiking, snorkeling, etc. There are snorkels, boogie boards, cooler, beach chairs, books about hiking, birds, towels, anything you could think of really, available for use by guests. They have also prepared a huge binder of information about the area that I found extremely useful. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great, in between Kea'au and Volcano and it was a quick trip to beach/snorkeling and excellent hiking in Volcanos National Park. Their home is in a beautiful fern forest and there are lots of birds during the day and singing coqui frogs at night. Sleeping to the sounds of frogs is the best. Kaeo is easily reached by phone, text, or going to her house if you need.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can't recommend Eco Hale enough. I would love to live there myself! \\r\\n \"},\n",

There was so much complimentary food, we couldn't finish it all! The lodge is isolated from the road, surrounded by exotic (to us) plants and animals and although it is a small drive from Hilo - trust us, it is worth it! The bathroom facilities were even better than some other bnb places we stayed in. Although, because it's an eco lodge, the water needs to be pumped every so often and if you go to the toilet in the middle of the night - it will wake the neighbours! Overall we rate it 9/10. You fall asleep to soft rain and the sounds of melodic (though a local pest) frogs and wake up to fresh fruit for breakfast. What more could you possibly want?! \"},\n",

Kaeo, you are extremely generous. Your hospitality, the numerous details, treats, and the special you decorated and maintain Eco Hale is an inspiration. Thank you for the amazing guide book (binder); we found it very useful. We enjoyed having beach gear to enjoy around the island, as well as the well equipped kitchen for our dinners at night. We will miss the sound of the frogs and the relaxing rain. MAHALO!! Natalia and Charlie, Austin, TX.'},\n",

Set in the middle of Kaeo and Karl's beautiful and extensive garden that felt like being in the middle of a tropical paradise. Kaeo was there to welcome us warmly and show us around. There were useful instructions in the room as well. What makes Eco Hale even more special are the personal touches. The beautiful welcome sign, the homemade quiche, bagels and soft drinks in the fridge, a bottle of wine from the region, beautiful fruit from the Garden, tea, coffee, creamer, cookies, nuts, herbs and spices… the list could go on. The toiletries in the bathroom were also lovely. To lie there at night listening to the rain and the sounds of the night was just something else. In fact we so enjoyed being in our little oasis that we spent more time there and less time racing around every single site Big Island has to offer. Instead we ticked off our must dos but left off our if we have time list as we found peace and tranquility at Eco Hale. I would highly recommend anyone spending time in Hilo and Volcano area of the island to stay with Kaeo and Karl at Eco Hale.\"},\n",

       "   'comments': 'Eco Hale embodies the spirit of \"E komo mai, nou ka hale\" or \"welcome, my house is yours.\"  The reviews are glowing and well deserved, but Eco Hale is the kind of place that you really need to experience to understand.  Eco Hale was built in a rain forest paradise.  This place is the real deal.  If you spend your entire vacation at a resort you will miss the authenticity and aloha that Kaeo and Karl give.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed four beautiful nights here.  Each night we kept the windows wide open.  The sweet scent of flowers poured in on the cool moist air.  Rain kept the rhythm while coqui frogs sang their little hearts out.  Controversial as they are, I now know why Puerto Ricans love the coqui.  Hear them in a soft rain, in the cool of evening with the lights down low, and you may believe the legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nEco Hale sits well off the beaten path and is accessed through a network of quiet two lane roads.  The hale is warm and comfortable.  The surrounding garden is Eden like.  Inside and out, the host\\'s attention to detail is remarkable.  Eco Hale is a place to appreciate and return to.

Their gardens were amazing, and it is on a perfect location to explore Volcano National Park, Puna district and only 20 miles from Hilo.

Sitting at the steps, sipping teas while listening to the birds and frogs at night with the tiki torch on was something unforgettable. The bed is just COMFY! \\r\\n\\r\\nKaeo and Karl has been so generous, they offered to dry our towels using their dryer when it was raining and invited us to a lovely Thanksgiving dinner! The stay at Eco hale was the highlight of our Hawaiian trip. Kaeo knows the island so well and has given us great tips on where to go and what to do. We were so happy to see some green sea turtles on our last day at the black sand beach, thanks to Kaeo! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe strongly recommend Eco Hale to anyone who is about to visit the big island.

She knows that her Eco Hale is an unusual place that attracts people who want a different experience of the Big Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is our second trip to the island, and we opted for airbnb hosts instead of the resort experience, precisely because we wanted contact with real people and their lives. We got this here - just the right amount. Kaeo and Karl were present but never invasive; always helpful and sweet. Kaeo also cooked an amazing meal for us - seared ahi on salad, perhaps the best dinner we have had on the island. We started off a 2-week trip by decompressing off-grid here. We’d say this was just the right amount of time to get a taste of this lifestyle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is exactly as pictured, with perhaps more luxuries than you’d imagine - plenty of soft towels, well equipped mini kitchen, and even warm fleeces and pants if you didn’t pack your own. The bathroom is accessed by the lanai, something that’s hard to understand from the photos, adding a fun novelty to the experience. We loved the comfort of being inside, sheltered from but living with millions of birds, abundant plants, and the sound of rain. Their rainforest garden is the real thing, and we enjoyed the novelty of juicing a few citruses directly from the trees.'},\n",

The whole property is a treasure trove of items collected and useful to enhance the stay.

Among many other things there was a lasagna waiting for us in the fridge and a short time later Kaeo reappears with a plate of yummy Sushi. There were all sorts of kitchen herbs and spices, coffee, teas - well the list goes on for ever. a huge bowl of oranges was left ready encouraging a morning ritual of squeezing for juice. Kano herself was a mind of information about sights and the local area and had a wicked sense of humour. Thank you very much for making our stay a most enjoyable one.'},\n",

It is quite an adventure to get there but once you arrive in this beautiful garden you will just love it. \\nAs it was my first airbnb experience I was very excited. But everything was just perfect. Kaeo was super friendly and gave me a great and warm welcome. She had great advice for what is there to do. I got a very delicious dinner at the first evening. And thanks for all the fruit! \\nEverything you need is in that beautiful house, even a rainjacket !!! :) actually I forgot mine on Oahu so I was pretty happy for that one. I suppose Kaeo and Karl put so much love in this house - you definetely will feel that everywhere! \\nThe bathroom is just great and very clean! You have plenty of privacy and if you get to catch Kaeo you have some nice chats! (I didn't get to know Karl but I am sure he is just as lovely as Kaeo is)\\nI had a really wonderful time there and enjoyed the dark nights with a lot of birds :-) \\nMahalo for this unique experience which I will always keep in my heart! \\nFranziska\"},\n",

Kaeo made us dinner the first night which was fabulous and also left us some treats which were fabulous. She didn't know this, but our anniversary was on the 18th and she brought us a big piece of chocolate cake. It made me so happy and we felt spoiled. The house is super clean and I just loved everything about it. The natural soundtrack of the birds, frogs and rain are so soothing. We utilized the kitchen for 4 meals and they had everything we needed as far as cookware, dishes, salt, pepper, etc. The gas on the burner ran out and they were so quick to replace it for us. Literally the most loving/giving people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They left us with fruit as well and there is a cool tree house that we ate dessert on one of the nights. Its just very peaceful and great to see that part of the island. The location is about 20 minutes to Hilo and 20 minutes to the Volcano park. Kaeo and Karl, thank you so much for the hospitality!! We will be recommending to all our friends that come for a visit. \"},\n",

Actually the whole communication has been super smooth and easy too. \\n\\nWe got a detailed description about the way and Kaeo was there to show us around when we arrived. What can I say, everything was provided in a very special and cute way! \\n\\nThe cabin has the cozy bedroom with a very comfortable bed and a kitchensink. There is space to store some luggage and food too, but you will find almost everything there to use too. Kaeo stocked the fridge with some goodies and fruits - we enjoyed so much. \\n\\nNext door, connected by the open air veranda and cooking-bar, there is the very special bathroom. The glass to the jungle is so great, kind of jungle shower-feeling! The bathroom is so clean!! As the whole cabin is. \\nIt was the 49th acommendation we stayed in, during our round the world trip and it has honesty been the most clean and most spiritual one. \\n\\nEverything is there- clean linen, good towels, quality toiletries, complimentary food items, the \"good night chocolate\", fresh fruits, drinking water, Big Island Information, a meditation place with a yoga mat, bodyboards, snorkeling gear, nice dishes and cooking items, great and fast gas cooking plate ...\\n\\nThe place is laid back, super calm and quite far away from everything. We loved the crickets chirping and jungle sounds during the night. Hilo is about 30-40 minutes to go, and there are some great organic food stores and a farmers market. \\n\\nThe wifi is slow and limited and I haven\\'t been prepared there will be an additional tax to pay due to departure when we booked. It was mentioned at least in the confirmation, but I just haven\\'t seen it. It can be very cold up there near Mountain View too. \\nKaeo and Karl were very welcoming with our Little One too. The cabin is small but nevertheless they arranged her a cute and cozy mattress and provided a lovely book!\\n\\nThe energy there is lovely and inspiring. This place is just a gem and ideal for some relaxed time, hiking the volcano and enjoy open air cooking with a view. \\n\\nWe all can highly recommend this pristine place - it is full of love and flow. \\nThank you, dear Kaeo and dear Karl!\\n\\n'},\n",

Coming into this, we knew it was a bit more remote, so we were fine with the limited wifi and no air conditioning.

The location is amazing if you are wanting to see the Volcano National Park, there is a Black Sand beach very close in Kalapana about 20 mins away from Eco Hale. The house is very cozy and romantic but definitely only able to comfortably accommodate two at the maximum. Also if you are wanting a resort experience free of culture, a little dirt, and nature you might as well stay in Kona. The Hale is truly off the grid and we couldn't have been happier with it. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing off the grid doesn't mean roughing it though. If you use the (provided) citronella candles on the porch bugs aren't an issue. The hot water is instantly hot, and a full kitchen setup is provided albeit a little unconventional. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hospitality provided for us was unlike anything you could ever dream of at any resort however. Kaeo provided us some treats and sandwiches upon checkin after getting in late and made us feel right at home, even offering to share some tasty Lasagna she had made for herself! We had a little bad luck with the weather pattern as it rained nearly everyday but Kaeo was there to take care of us and made sure we had clean and dry towels. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the home cooked meals, homemade cookies, homemade bread, and fresh fruit, Kaeo was always there for advice on what to see, tips on the grocery stores nearby, farmers markets, etc, etc. We really did feel like family and cannot wait til our next visit to the Big Island!\\r\\n\\r\\n- John and Carrie\"},\n",

This place is a ways off the highway but is so private that it makes you feel like you alone on the island. We loved it. '},\n",

We stayed for 2 days and our experience was somewhat mixed. \\r\\nBe sure not to use GPS to get here since the roads are not paved - Kaeo will remind you of her detailed notes and instructions she provides (which is somewhat hard to follow without a map). While we enjoyed staying in the cabin, it's not everyone's cup of tea since its rather remote and rustic. The cabin is stocked with fruits and breakfast items - a nice surprise. Our interaction with Kaeo was mixed - sometimes friendly and welcoming and other times quite abrasive which made us feel very uncomfortable on more than one occasion. Overall, we probably wouldn't stay here again.\"},\n",

       "   'comments': 'We arrived at Kaeo and Karl cottage under a stormy rain after driving the whole afternoon from Kona. It was so dark that we barely could see the car in front of us. It was hard to see the streets and landmarks Kaeo sent on the very detailed directions weeks in advance. So I recommend arriving when there is light. Kaeo was the most amazing hostess. Her first question was if we had dinner and since we said no, she immediately said there was quiche on the fridge and brought us a delicious salad. We had a great dinner inside the cozy cottage. The cottage is very comfortable with a queen size bed, four pilows and lots of covers for the chilly nights. The kitchen is full equipped and the bathroom very spacious - it is a separate room, so you need to go outside and enter the next door. The water is hot and the shower has good pressure. The cottage is totally isolated with a private lanai and garden full of beautiful plants and flowers. The famous banana bread was on the fridge and it was yummy! Next day we got fruit muffins, also yummy. You have to have in mind that you are in the middle of tropical rain forest with the next \"town\" (Volcano village) 30 minutes away. So come with all your adventurous spirit. It was a great experience and Kaeo is really one of the best hostess ever. She thought of every single detail and demonstrated really care for her guests. Mahalo Kaeo!!'},\n",

We even took our wedding pictures in their topical garden. The tropical garden is beautiful and full of tasty fruits! Kaeo even baked us a banana papaya bread (using ingredients straight from the garden) and it was hands down the BEST banana bread I've ever had! Eco Hale is located in a beautiful rainforest part of the Hawaii and it was a relaxing trip. Coming from a big loud fast paced city the sound of the rain, birds, and animals was just peaceful! We slept with the windows open during our 7 day trip and it was the best sleep I've had in awhile. We really liked that the place is eco friendly. I really recommend this place if you enjoy nature and trying to escape the city life. Its perfect to unwind and be free.\"},\n",

       "   'comments': 'We just got back from a 2 wk vacation on the Big Island and Eco Hale was our favorite Airbnb experience.  I had worried it would be too small or remote but for us it was the perfect Hawaiian experience.  Kaeo met us in the drive as if we were old friends coming to visit.  We had communicated by text the day before about our expected arrival time and need to go grocery shopping.  As noticed in other reviews she promised us some vegetable pasta upon arrival saving us a trip from Volcano Village back to Hilo for supplies and allowing for more time to explore the National Park. The grounds around Eco Hale are lush with flora and fauna plus quaint garden art.  We could tell much thought was put into the decor of the Hale, food & drink treats, and general household items and beach gear available for our use. It was like staying in a Hawaiian playhouse.  We made much use of cooking equipment at night on our little porch after shopping at local Farmers Markets. The above pasta was delish as was fresh banana bread left on the kitchen counter. Garden fruits and other food staples were available in the frig and pantry.  The bathroom was large and there was plenty of hot water and drinking water available.  My husband and I are types who when on vacation are up and out early, back just before dark, and tired from our long day so Eco Hale could not have been a better choice for us.  The location is perfect for exploring the HA Natl Volcano Park and the entire Puna area.  We particularly loved the night sounds, sort of jungle-like.  Wish we had booked more nights at Eco Hale for there is much Aloha there.'},\n",

We kept in touch with Kaeo and Karl to let them know our flight arrival was a bit late and they were OK with letting us come on ahead.  We arrived after dark and had no problem finding the gate.  If you follow Kaeo's directions exactly and keep an eye out for the numbers on the street pavement as indicated, you won't have any trouble.  We felt welcome as soon as we arrived as Kaeo promptly and graciously introduced herself and handed us a piping hot tureen of delicious vegetable and soba noodle soup, which we devoured.   Kaeo got us all set up with keys and additional information and left us to our own devices.  We sadly didn't meet Karl as he had family in town.  Upon entering the cabin, we were also pleased to find a selection of home-grown and local fruits on the counter that was more than we could eat...but we tried!  Kaeo also brought us a loaf of home baked banana bread (delicious with coffee and fruit in the morning) and cookies for us (which saved us on one of our long hikes in the park).  \\r\\nThe cabin information and photos that were provided in the listing were accurate, so we knew what to expect.  The main room in the cabin is a fairly small space, which we expected, but was large enough for both my husband and I to move around, prepare meals, eat, read and sleep.  Eco Hale is perfect for a single or couple.  It was very clean, cozy and comfortable.  The kitchenette area is well set up for making your own meals by outdoor gas single cook-top, or indoor microwave, a bar-sized sink, and a small fridge.  There were plenty of kitchen tools, plates, pans, coffee grinder, french press, as well as condiments, coffee beans, teas and other amenities.  The bathroom with shower is separate and spacious with plenty of on-demand hot water and room to change in.  Eco Hale was centrally located between Hilo and Volcano National Park so it was easy for us to move between each location.  We were amazed at the attention to detail in this little cabin from the artistic decorative touches, inspirational quotes, our own personalized welcome sign which made us feel special (thank you!), extra reading materials, local information and to-do recommendations, beach and snorkeling gear, ice chest, recycle bins, drinking water, extra pillows and blankets, a cd player with a box of cds that we enjoyed, internet hotspot, playing cards, a guest book, a hide-away tree platform, and so much more! \\r\\nAll this is to say, we highly recommend this little gem and these wonderful gracious hosts.   \"},\n",

       "   'comments': \"My wife and I stayed at Eco Hale for 3 nights on an anniversary trip which also included stays at The Royal Hawaiian (Oahu) and Sheraton Kona Resort (Kailua-Kona). Without question, our fondest memories of the trip are the ones we made here. From the moment we pulled into the driveway, where Kaeo welcomed us as if she had known us our entire lives, we felt the special-ness of the place. The cabin itself is beautiful, clean, and filled with personal touches. It strikes the perfect balance between offering just enough modern convenience to feel luxurious (electricity, hot water on demand, etc.) while eschewing things like television which would detract from the natural beauty and intimacy of the setting. This is truly a place to step back, slow down, and relax. We loved falling asleep to the sound of the rain pitter-pattering on the roof and the frogs chirping outside the windows. Also, the location is ideal for exploring the volcano and the Hilo side of the island, which we ended up far preferring over the Kona side. We met several folks at the Kona resorts who only did day trips to the volcano, and I think that's a tragic mistake. The eastern side of the island is far more lush and beautiful, and offers numerous hikes, vistas, waterfalls, and gardens for those who appreciate that sort of thing. We followed several of Kaeo's recommendations and were not disappointed. In short, we could not recommend Eco Hale more highly, and hope one day to have the opportunity to return.\"},\n",

       "   'comments': \"When we arrived in Hawaii after a long and somewhat arduous journey with a 9-month old baby we were welcomed with actual open arms by Kaeo.  She was so kind, caring, and open and we felt instantly at home.  \\r\\nWe were greeted with a delicious dinner and each day would come home to find mandarins, oranges, lemons, avocados, and delicious home-baked treats at our door step.\\r\\nBoth Kaeo and Karl were incredibly helpful in planing out stay, and even though we knew we could always go next door to ask them questions, we also felt that we were completely alone and isolated in our little jungle retreat.\\r\\nThe accommodations were clean, neat, and simple but small, so if you aren't comfortable sharing a small space with your traveling partner know that you'll be in close quarters.  Despite the size the Hale never feels small or cramped and everything is organized so perfectly that you'll wonder why you ever thought you needed so much space!  We loved the experience (and challenge) of our outdoor kitchen and found ourselves cooking delicious meals with local produce and will forever miss our fresh-squeezed juices each morning.\\r\\nYou're definitely off the beaten path here, so be prepared for some driving (30 minutes and up) if you want to go the National Park, beaches, or into Hilo.  We felt it was well-worth it to do the extra driving.  \\r\\nIts also good to note that this is an Eco Hale in the Rainforest- so be prepared for rain!  While your days might get wet, falling asleep to the sound of rain and coqui frogs singing can't be topped!\\r\\nIn short, our time at Kaeo and Karl's was wonderful, special, memorable, and beautiful and we HIGHLY recommend it!\"},\n",

We got homemade bananabread, oatmealbars, tons of fresh fruit, the fridge was filled with drinks (limonade,beer) and on our first evening we got a big plate with food, small plated with seafood and amaaaaaazing pineapple cheesecake. everything you need is there. Its soo clean and cozy, bugs were no problem, as long as you dont leave the door wide open. We loved the big island, we loved this place and we loved having these amazing hosts.

Kaeo and Karl did everything (and more) to make our stay enjoyable. Their cottage has everything we needed and a lot more that we did not excpect. The surroundings are drop dead gorgeous- a carefully maintained tropical foliage, the sounds of Coqui frogs at night and birds in the morning make the scene almost surreal. The owners are friendly, helpful and give 100% privacy if that's what you require. Karl designed the cottage perfectly, the large bathroom window is overlooking the garden yet it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable (read- yes, you can walk naked all you want:)) Kaeo spoiled us many times with great local food and fruits, which we devoured immediately:)\\r\\nThe location is perfect for exploring Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, the Hilo side of the island and it's not far from Hawai'i most amazing mountain, Mauna Kea. \\r\\nIn overall, we can recommend Karl & Kaeo cottage in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a clean, affordable accommodation in the southeastern part of Big Island. Once again, mahalo for everything, we will never forget you and your great place and hopefully, our paths will cross again in the nearest future.   \"},\n",

Kaeo welcomed us in her driveway with open arms and led us into the private, rustic eco hale which is neatly tucked away in the middle of rainforest. The place is exactly as described in the photos and truly a unique experience for any traveller. We were also spoiled with homemade treats each day, which made us feel loved and cared for. The eco hale has everything that you would need for a rural retreat and so much more. We were pleasantly surprised to see trail guides for the day trips in the Volcanoes National Park, as well as blankets and hot water flasks for night trips to the volcano. Falling asleep to the sounds of crickets and birds and cooking on the patio with the rainforest in full view was also a delight. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable Airbnb experience. Definitely the best we have had a so far! Mahalo K & K :)\"},\n",

Not only was it beautiful, but Keao was an INCREDIBLE host. She came to check on us and left us the most delicious baked goods we've ever had, and I'm assuming they were all made with local ingredients because they were amazing. Her banana macadamia but bread was my absolute favorite. We are from the east coast, just outside of New York City, so staying in the heart of the Hawaiian rainforest was truly something we will never forget and treasure forever. Falling asleep to the sound of rain on all the trees and the soothing sound of whistling tree frogs was a memory that we will hold dear to us for years to come. You are a short drive (15-20 minutes) from Kilauea or the town of Hilo in both directions. There are countless outdoor adventures, such as breath taking tide pools, waterfalls, and driving to the top of Mauna Kea (one of the best thing's we've ever seen), and being a short drive away from all these incredible adventures is just perfect. I really have no words for how awesome this experience was. To anyone thinking about staying at Eco Hale... DO IT - you won't regret it!\\r\\nIf I could give this a 1,000 star rating I would. We LOVED staying here, and would 100% come back. Thank you Kaeo and Karl for making our honeymoon everything we had dreamed of!!!!\"},\n",

She takes great pride in her space, and makes sure you have everything you need for a relaxing, complete stay. The difference with Kaeo and Karl and with Eco Hale, is the true experience of a Bed and Breakfast. There was everything provided from sweats and slippers, to a fully stocked kitchen, to the drinking water tank being magically filled every day, to a thank you note and parting gift at the end. Nothing was missed, and it made us feel welcome, relaxed, and at home far away from home. Even with all of these extras, we did not see Kaeo or Karl during our stay after check-in, and were given the privacy that allowed for a perfect stay. Eco Hale is a dreamy little spot with a magical bathroom and a porch perfect for playing cards, eating dinner, and listening to the rain and coquis. We missed making pancakes on the porch and eating fresh fruit every morning the rest of our trip! Such a perfect way to start your day. We only wish we would have booked it towards the end of our trip when that vacation exhaustion starts to set in and you want to relax in your accommodations! Kaeo has a passion for hosting and it truly shines through. We would recommend to anyone staying on Hawaii Island to stay here! Thank you Kaeo! '},\n",

I would say that this experience was the perfect definition of \"balance\". \\r\\n-Balance between hospitality and privacy. (We knew they were there if we needed anything, but we were also totally free to come and go as we pleased. And we tended to leave early and arrive late, as we spent our days exploring the island.) \\r\\n-Balance between a getaway in the rain forest and accessibility to everything. (You fall asleep to the sounds of frogs, but are only a short drive from Hilo, Volcano National Park, Mauna Kea...)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are thinking about booking with Kaeo & Karl, don\\'t hesitate!!!\\r\\nIt was amazing, and one of our favorite memories of the island.

We are highly recommending this place if you're staying at the Volcano area for a few nights (we stayed 3 nights - note that the place is tiny, so if you're not travelling light, you probably don't want to stay more than that).\"},\n",

And our host, Kaeo. We ADORE her. She is the loveliest. Hospitality incarnate.\\r\\nThe cottage itself is composed of two rooms: a cozy bedroom with a compact/efficient kitchen space and a bathroom that is impeccably clean with beautiful custom tilework lining the shower walls. The interior spaces spill out onto a small porch with more kitchen space and outdoor seating. There, you\\'re nestled into a lush rainforest-garden, secluded from it all, and connected to the tropical surroundings in a way that can only happen in a place like Mountain View. The frequent rain showers, the warm sunlight through all the green, and the sound of birds and frogs envelope you in a whole new world. \\r\\nKaeo has appointed every corner of the cottage with things to make your stay comfortable and memorable. Home-baked hiking bars and a beautiful tray of fresh fruit are just two examples of the many \"gifts\" you may find at Eco Hale. Twenty minutes from Volcano (current lava flows are spectacular), the Puna coast (dappled with natural lava-warmed pools and home to one of our favorite things--the Wednesday night-market), and Hilo (a fun town to explore which borders waterfall country) make this location ideal for exploring important must-see sections of the island. We love having Mountain View as our home-base and no doubt we will be returning once again.'},\n",

We can\\'t wait to come back!! I felt the location was perfect. The kitchen was well stocked, grills and \"stove\" out on the porch were clean and well working. My only complaint is that it\\'s damp  and feels much colder than it is. Obviously you\\'re in a jungle/rainforest so that\\'s a given but the space only has 3 windows, no heating/air conditioning, fans. So to get fresh air you have too open windows/door and it lets in so much moisture. BUT the water at the space was hot when needed. Bed was springy, neither very soft or hard, lots of extra blankets and pillows. \\n\\nWe were about 1-2 hours from everything we wanted to do. We went to a black sand beach, hiked the 5 miles round trip to the green sand beach, went to Hilina Pali, and saw snow on Mauna Kea (which is on the way to the airport). We found two health food stores, island naturals in Hilo (a one stop shop!), and Keaau natural foods who has raw macadamia nuts that are out of this world! After the green sand beach there is a yummy Thai place called is lae garden and just up the way a mile or so is a pizza place that advertised gluten free and vegan called DJ pizza. Stop at the kona brewery if you fly into kona. Their food is amazing, strawberry salad and sweet potato pie were A+!! Kaeo gave us great ideas and pointed us in the right direction to find what we wanted to do. She also has huge binders of info in the room of local things and volcanos. Really awesome!

It is a small space and perfectly adequate...cozy is the word! We appreciated our hosts and the communication prior to and during our visit. And we appreciated the privacy they accorded us as well! Wonderful treats, travel tips and even a device to pluck fresh oranges from the bountiful tree out front. Yes, you will need to do some driving to the rainforest location, but the unique and memorable experience makes it totally worth it.'},\n",

Cozy bed, umbrellas, ponchos, separate bathroom, snokerling gear, beach chairs, comfy bed, mugs, plates and some more. It also has a bunch of binders with all the information about the island. You don't even need (Hidden by Airbnb) for anything. Everything is right there in the binders. Can only imagine the amount of time they have spent creating those binders and keeping it up to date. But that is not the best part of the hale. Its the location location location. Its in the middle of a rainforest. And you fall off to sleep to the sounds of birds, rain and frogs. Never had a peaceful sleep like this before. It brought back memories of our native place back home. The pictures do not do justice to the Hale. You have to live there to feel it :)\\n\\nI don't even know how to be grateful to the hosts. We did not get a chance to meet Karl but Kaeo was there to welcome us and was able to accommodate an early checkin request. She is such a wonderful lady to talk to. She is so welcoming and she really wants you to have a great time. We felt like a part of their family. There were fruits, baked goodies for us on arrival. And everyday she would leave something for us on the porch to eat :)\\n\\nThere is absolutely no reason for you to not stay here if you are visiting Hilo. Like I said, the location is amazing but the hosts are even more amazing. We had the best vacation of our life. And we'll defnitley come back to Eco Hale next time we are on the island.\\n\\nTo Kaeo and karl, we are forever in debt for the warm hospitality and for letting us be a part of your home. Mahalo from the bottom of our hearts.\\n\\nP.S: The Hale is best suitable for two people. It's not very huge and no closet space so its best if you have minimal luggage. We had one check-in bag and two carry ons and we did just fine.\"},\n",

This little house was perfect for our needs - it was clean, had a very nice garden, the bed is very confortable and we had full privacy.\\n\\nTheir generosity is just phenomenal. On our arrival, Kaeo have prepared us an appetizer which was gluten free due to my dietary restriction (it was very nice from her to pay attention to all the small details). Also, we had plenty of fruits on the counter, banana bread (really tasty) and other goodies in the fridge for the breakfast. During the week she also offered us a dinner that she had prepared during the day. Once again, she is a really good cook and we have really appreciate everything she was doing for us!\\n\\nIt is an amazing spot for those who like to hike since it is very close from Volcano. Many information on the trails were available in the information book in the house. \\n\\nDuring our stay, we had one rainy day and Kaeo was really kind and put our wet towel in her dryer in order for us to have dry towels the next day. \\n\\nWe will recommend this place at 100% to everyone who is going to Big Island. \\n\\nMahalo\\nMel & Simon'},\n",

I was a solo adventurer for 9 days and loved everything about the place. Everything is there for amenities and I didn't need anything else. I went to the store and farmer's markets (plenty to choose from!) for the staples when I wanted to make any sort of meals for my stay which was nice. The fresh fruit, little treats, and yummy meals were a treat I wasn't expecting and they were so yummy!  I didn't meet Karl this trip, but his touches he put on building this beautiful humble abode was perfect. Kaeo is the sweetest and most adorable free spirit and I couldn't have asked for more from her! Her local tips in the binders are perfect and lovely for when you want to check out everything around you and across the Island. Very well put together! If I had a question while across the Island, she responded almost immediately with advice or tips. I loved falling asleep to the local wildlife and rain, as well as waking up to the beautiful sun shine and birds chirping. The tree platform was perfect for when I needed to just soak the sun and relax. Be ready to sit back and just relax with while staying at the Eco Hale. Kaeo and Karl have done such a wonderful job putting this magical place together to share with the world! I plan to visit again in the future and I have no questions as to where I will be staying on my next trip to the Big Island! Aloha and Mahalo K2!\"},\n",

It is a bit small if you have a ton of luggage, but luckily with the covered porch, we were able to set some of it outside. It did get a little humid in the room, so some airflow of a fan  you could run for a while would be nice. She does live \"off the grid\" using solar panels and rain water, which is so fascinating. Keep that in mind with regards to running electricity and water though.\\nYou can really tell that she loves playing hostess.

There was a gas burner and kettle that I used to make tea and sit on the patio each morning. Kaeo & Karl also have all kinds of equipment, flash lights, and recommendations available for your adventuring. We spent a day and a half at the Hawaii Volcano National Park, which was unbelievable! I would highly recommend going to the park and taking a ranger guided hike so you can get all kinds of recommendations about where to go and how to do it safely. One of the highlights of our trip was taking a bicycle ride and hike to see the active lava flows at dusk. The park is also open 24/7, so you can drive to the Jaggar Museum after dark to see the active gas-eruption at the Halema'uma'u\\xa0crater.\"},\n",

Kaeo\\'s directions were clear and concise which we greatly appreciated having never been to the Island of Hawaii before. A complementary dinner was provided when we arrive which was homemade and delicious!! Kaeo also made a wonderful banana nut bread for us to enjoy as well! Sweets and treats were provided throughout our stay which helped make us feel welcome and at home. Unlocking/locking the gate to the property was not an inconvenience and helped us feel secure. Eco Hale is beautifully placed in the backyard of Karl and Kaeo\\'s property which allowed for easy communication and quick response to requests. The position and distance between Kaeo and Karl\\'s home from Eco Hale maintained privacy for me and my husband throughout our stay. The bathroom is separate from the bedroom and my husband and I felt comfortable going back and forth in the privacy of Eco Hale. We enjoyed waking up each morning to make French press coffee, hand squeezing fresh orange juice from the juicing oranges on the property, and eating fresh tangerines picked from the trees. The complementary breakfast and stocked mini fridge with juices, yogurt, were a wonderful plus!! Eco Hale is in the rain forrest side of the island which can make nights and mornings chilly in December. Kaeo and Karl provided a few extra sweatpants and blankets hanging up in the closet just incase of colder weather. This closet is filled with useful items! Kaeo and Karl have provided so many items we didn\\'t think we needed. Binoculars, snorkel goggle de-fogger, flashlights, plenty of informational books, beach chairs, beach towels!! The property is gorgeous and filled with all kinds of plants and flowers lining the small trails and garden. The chirps and sounds of the rain forrest nightlife are mesmerizing. Soaking in the OFuro soaking tub was calming and soothing after a day of hiking in HVNP. Kaeo and Karl also encourage recycling and composting, which my husband and I loved!! The 1G wireless was a convenient but also kept cell phone use to minimum. My husband and I wanted a \"no-phone-zone\" so we used the wireless only to research our activities for the next day. The binder provided by Kaeo and Karl was extremely helpful and filled with information about activities to do in Hawaii, appliance guides, items provided in Eco Hale, and more!! We were off on so many adventures throughout the day that Kaeo provided a basket for us to fill for laundry! This was completely unexpected yet so appreciated!!! From Eco Hale my husband and I achieved so much in 5 days!!

Tiki hut...our nickname) that truly immerses you in the Hawaii rainforest. Absolute privacy with only the sights, sounds, feel and smells of the dense growth, birds and occasional rain showers. Nothing better than enjoying a leisurely breakfast of fresh picked frujt, Kaeo's home-baked sweet bread and freshly ground coffee on the open-air bar.  Or capping an action-full day soaking in the Japanese Ofuro tub.\\nSecond, Eco Hale's location is perfect. A short drive from Hilo airport, Hawaii Volcanoes NP and the wild and beautiful Puna coast. In the course of our four days, we experienced:\\n-- a full day exploring craters, lava flows, lava tubes capped off by a magnificent lava fountain courtesy of Kilauea's lava lake in the evening.\\n-- dramatic coastal scenes on the island's eastern coast, ranging from desolate to serene\\n-- active lava closing we witnessed in awe by hiking from Kalapana\\n-- excellent dining in funky Paula\\nThird, Kaeo's warm welcome and boundless hospitality is remarkable. Every possible activity, from snorkeling to Bird-watching to hanging at the beach, has been provided for.  She is truly a sweet soul.\\nThank you, K&K!\\nMark & Sharon\"},\n",

If you're looking to 'get away from it all' in an exotic rain forest setting while still being close to all the attractions of Hilo, Volcano etc. this is the ideal choice. While the accommodation is relatively small it has everything you could need and more. On top of that, there's the little treats that appear now and then (cookies, chocolates, drinks etc.) even though there's a great selection of food waiting for you when you arrive. While Kaeo provides all of the privacy you could want, she also works in the background to ensure your stay is perfect (taking towels away to dry and responding to requests immediately). A couple of tips; the chirping frogs are all part of being in the rain forest but you might want to bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper and make sure to check out the night sky while you're there, the number of stars you can see is breathtaking!\"},\n",

They are the most wonderful hosts who have put so much thought into the creation of the ultimate home away from home. The hale was easy to get to thanks to the detailed instructions that were sent to me ahead of time. Kaeo met me as I pulled in, proudly showed me around the hale, and welcomed me to contact her with any questions before she gracefully left me on my own. You do need to un/lock the gate to the drive as you come and go off the property but it is easy peasy. The hale itself is separated from the main house by lush greenery so I enjoyed having a lot of privacy and much-needed quiet. The pupu dinner I'd requested was divine, as were the fruit, cookies, and sweet bread that were also left for me to enjoy. The kitchen was perfectly appointed and I loved being able to cook myself breakfast out on the lanai while brewing coffee in a french press. The east side of the island was chillier than I expected and Kaeo graciously provided me an extra comforter and a cozy sweater to borrow. The bathroom is as adorable as one can be and is right next door to the bedroom, making for a lovely experience of a hybrid indoor/outdoor suite in the middle of the rainforest. My first night I took advantage of the Japanese soaking tub and meditated amid candlelight and the symphony of the coqui frogs. The bed was very comfy and I slept like a baby each night. I absolutely cannot wait to return to the Eco Hale and hopefully, will have more time to chat more with Kaeo, who is a dynamic and loving host. Mahalo nui loa, Kaeo and Karl, and much love to you from Seattle until we meet again!\"},\n",

It was very special to have this even after having been at a crowded tourist spot earlier in the day. Definitely my preference over crowded resort spots by a long shot! We are lucky places like this exist, and that people like Kaeo and Karl share them with us. This made our anniversary (and engagement!) very special.

Very cool for these Portland environmentalists.\\n\\nLiterally the only cons I can come up with: there's a lot of moisture (I mean, you're in a rainforest), so towels practically never dried and I woke up feeling damp at night.

From check in to check out and all points in between, you can be certain they’ve thought of it. \\n\\nWe came in late at night and while navigating the dark back roads can be a little tricky, their directions have plenty of physical markers to get you there safely. Just be aware, this area is a bit more isolated (about 20m south of Hilo) with spotty cell service, which for us was part of the appeal. But is something to consider when organizing points of interest. \\n\\nEven though it’s isolated with tons of flowers, lush trees, and plants, we were PLEASANTLY surprised by the lack of bugs. I mean sure there’s mosquitos and the occasional beetle looking thing but we didn’t see much more then that. And overall build quality is incredible! It was pouring rain a good duration of the time we were there and not a single drop or leak was anywhere to be found. \\n\\nOh and talk about treats and thoughtful touches galore! There was a welcoming meal of lasagna, shrimp Cesar salad, and even a gift since my bday had been a few days prior. \\n\\nThere’s so much more I’d love to share but it still wouldn’t do Eco Hale justice.

       "   'comments': 'Eco Hale was amazing!  My partner and I fell in love with the place immediately.  There’s nothing like being in the middle of a rain forest, with just the sounds of birds, gentle rain, and the otherworldly sounds of coqui frogs chirping at night.  It was so calming, relaxing, soothing.  A switch goes off in your brain when being there. I wanted to spend as much time as possible there just soaking it in.\\n\\nIt’s definitely off the beaten path.  After you leave the main highway, it’s still a long ways in.  But of course this is why it’s so remote and quiet.  We barely noticed the main house where Kaeo and Karl live because the property is so lush.  Kaeo gave us a quick tour and some instructions on how to use the furo, stove, etc. and then left us alone to enjoy our little slice of paradise.  Over the next three days we communicated by text message and handwritten notes, and Kaeo would leave us the most ono (delicious) homemade goodies every day.    This was on top of a well-stocked mini fridge and a full water dispenser, and many other amenities.  Kaeo and Karl thought of everything, and then some.\\n\\nI am a Hawaii resident and have been to the Big Island dozens of times.  My main advice is, don’t try to see all of Hawaii Island in one trip.  Eco Hale is a great location from which to see the volcano area, the small towns in Puna, Hilo, and on up to the middle of the Hamakua Coast.   We also did Mauna Kea as a day trip (staying until sunset).  The driving distances on the Big Island are so great that you do not want to cram too much into a few days, since you would just spend most of your time driving and not nearly enough time enjoying the island lifestyle.\\n\\nAt Eco Hale the temperature at night was cool, and between the cool air and the coqui frogs, I slept like a baby.  Coqui frogs are controversial in Hawaii.  They were introduced and they spread quickly on Hawaii Island.  Some people are bothered by their chirping, but I’m not one of them.  It just made it feel more like were  in some exotic place in a rainforest.  The feeling reminded me of my travels years ago, when I stayed in off-the-beaten-path places in Bali and Thailand, where the pace of life is so much slower.\\n\\nIn short, this has been our favorite AirBnb!\\n'},\n",

There are so many small touches that make it feel extra special, and there is nothing that you need that they don't have! We rode out Hurricane Hector's rains and winds that came through but it somehow made their place even more magical. (And they kept us up to date on the current weather and path prediction during the hurricane watch). The rain on the roof and the thunder rumbling in the distance while soaking in the tub waiting for the first frogs to start singing us into the night is one of my favorite memories I have from our Hawaiian Honeymoon. All of the fruits, flowers and baked goods were the most wonderful little surprises. We WILL return once HVNP is reopened (we booked before the eruption) to enjoy some hiking and to be serenaded to sleep by the rain and frogs.\"},\n",

In the ad the price was 76 $ and it said that prices vary, so I paid 110 $ for one night. With the description how to get to the place another fee (15% tax on total price) came up that hadn't been mentioned anywhere in the ad (I checked the ad several times). So the price for the room was actually 125 $, which is close to double from advertised. \\nIt is also very far from Hilo, it takes a 40-min-ride to get there, so I can only recommend it, if you want to enjoy the jungle sounds.\"},\n",

There were fresh flowers everywhere, BESIDES being in the middle of a rainforest garden!  Kaeo prepared a delicious meal for our first night at their place, asking ahead of time what we like and could or couldn\\'t have.  Her communication with stellar!  The whole place was very quaint and fun.  \\n\\nThe bathroom is not attached to the bedroom, so you have go outside to get to it, but it is three steps away and the place is COMPLETELY ISOLATED and private, so you can move back and forth in your PJs, a towel, or nothing at all without being seen by anyone.  The towels were thick, the bed was comfortable, the space immaculate.  The outdoor area was super inviting.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t use the outdoor tub because we were always gone in the evening during the hours it is able to be used, but I thought it was an incredibly cool option.\\n\\nThe space is near Volcano National Park, not too far from the fabulous Botanical Gardens, and you MUST check out the coffee place a couple miles down the main highway toward Hilo!  The coffee is great and the folks are very nice.  Say \"hi\" to Destiny for us!  (She is a young women that recognized us when we returned the second day for more coffee.)\\n\\nWe had two concerns; the space was quite small.  We have the type of suitcases that have to be laid flat to find anything and we could not open both suitcases at the same time.  This seemed like a big deal the first day, but we grew used to it.  (There is space outside on the porch for a suitcase, but didn\\'t want to have to do that everyday.)  If you are into little spaces or are flexible, you will think this is a very small deal.  We just got a little claustrophobic about it.\\n\\nThe second thing (and I apologize I didn\\'t say something to Kaeo about this in person) is the shower temperature fluctuates greatly.  I spent more time in the shower waiting for the water to get to a reasonable temperature than I did showering.  (And I\\'m not too picky about the temperature.'},\n",

The hospitality they show should also be the gold standard for Airbnb hosts - from cooking us an arrival dinner to surprising us with a Christmas gift on Dec 25, they really care about making their guests feel at home in every way possible. \\n\\nMy only advice would be to consider before booking if you are comfortable with a certain degree of ruggedness. The fact that this eco-hale is in the rainforest means it’s more often than not heavily raining, and the Airbnb receives a number of insects which are harmless but can be annoying when they swarm around you nonetheless. It’s location is also very remote, which lends to its beauty, but also makes it scary driving home on a road with no lights past sunset. \\n\\nThat being said, these are only minor comments that I feel should be shared with future guests when booking.

The Wonderful City of Rio has so much to offer as I have learned from my own experience, from the traditional Samba during Carnival to the less-known Parque das Ruinas in Santa Teresa (all close by the apartment). We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local \"cariocas\". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables. The apartments that I have to offer are fully equipped, well located, and I will personally make sure you enjoy your stay, without invading your space. I live close by, and can be reached almost any time of day or night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look forward to meeting you!\\r\\n\\r\\nCarpe Diem\\r\\n\\r\\nSou Inglês, mais moro no Rio ha 20 anos, tenho dois filhos quem nasceram aqui (agora eles estão estudando fora), e trabalho no mercado financeiro. Acredito nessa cidade maravilhosa e as oportunidades que oferece no futuro - como certamente me passou nas ultimas duas décadas. A gente vive aprendendo, e para qualquer um de vocês planejando visitar Rio de Janeiro, eu diria para ficar com mente aberta, e você vai crescer como uma pessoa, absorvendo só um pouco da experiência Rio tem para lhe provar. Já viajei o mundo, e adoro o som dos ritmos diferentes, comida extraordinária e povo tão caloroso. Meu filme favorito no momento e os Intocáveis. Os apartamentos que tenho para lhe oferecer são bem equipados, localizados, e eu cuido da sua visita pessoalmente, sem invadir seu espaço. Qualquer ajuda, só preciso me ligar - moro bem perto.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarpe Diem\\r\\n',\n",
